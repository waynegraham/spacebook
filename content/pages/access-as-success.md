Access is at the heart of accessibility, and access underlies success ([Nagle & Vitez, 2021](https://uspirgedfund.org/sites/pirg/files/reports/Fixing%20the%20Broken%20Textbook%20Market%2C%203e%20February%202021.pdf)). If our users can't access the information or content they need, in the ways they need, they will not accomplish what they wanted to.

In the [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/the-convention-in-brief.html), the United Nations calls upon countries to "promote access to information by providing information intended for the general public in accessible formats and technologies (Article 21)." Designing your digital materials with accessibility in mind helps you meet the fundamental right to information among a much broader population.
