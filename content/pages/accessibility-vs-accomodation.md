Don't make content or services accessible only when someone asks for it. That creates a barrier to inclusive access and can discourage users from making a request. Creating content and services with accessibility in mind fosters an inclusive environment for all users. Accessible U states that [accessibility is proactive; accommodation is reactive](https://accessibility.umn.edu/node/801), where

- **Accessibility = equal access for everyone, by design**

- **Accommodation = additional support for needs that have not been met**

Make accessible choices now to support accommodations more quickly, cheaply, and effectively in the future.
