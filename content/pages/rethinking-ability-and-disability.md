Jay Dolmage's book [Academic Ableism](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/u/ump/mpub9708722/1:4/--academic-ableism-disability-and-higher-education?rgn=div1;view=fulltext) provides some definitions to consider:

> Disablism" can be defined as "a set of assumptions (conscious or unconscious) and practices that promote the differential or unequal treatment of people because of actual or presumed disabilities" (Kumari Campbell, 4). Disablism, in short, negatively constructs disability. Disablism negatively constructs both the values and the material circumstances around people with disabilities. Disablism says that there could be nothing worse than being disabled, and treats disabled people unfairly as a result of these values. Ableism, on the other hand, instead of situating disability as bad and focusing on that stigma, positively values able-足bodiedness. In fact, ableism makes able-足bodiedness and able-足mindedness compulsory. Disablism constructs disability as negative quite directly and literally. Ableism renders disability as abject, invisible, disposable, less than human, while able-足bodiedness is represented as at once ideal, normal, and the mean or default.

When thinking of all the different abilities of people engaging with digital content, focus on the social model of disability. Traditionally, people view disability through what is referred to as the medical model, which:

- defines disability as something that needs to be cured or fixed;

- focuses on the problem as something that resides within the individual.

When thinking about the work done to reduce and remove barriers for people of all abilities, using the social model of disability:

- focuses on how society does or does not allow an impairment to disable the person with the impairment;

- defines the problem as something in the environment, not the individual.

When addressing digital content work with an accessibility mindset, use the social model of disability.
