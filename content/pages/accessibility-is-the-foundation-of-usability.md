  title: Accessibility is the Foundation of Usability

[ISO9241-11](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16883), defines usability as:

> The "extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals effectively, efficiently and with satisfaction in a specified context of use".

Broadly speaking, accessibility work supports all people but is critical to those who have impairments. It improves access to information. For instance, captions on videos are used by people _without_ hearing impairments for a multitude of reasons such as needing the sound low or off, facilitating memory and retention, understanding unclear parts or how words are spelled, and learning the language. The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) describes [how accessibility and usabilityoverlap](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-usability-inclusion/#accessible-usable).
