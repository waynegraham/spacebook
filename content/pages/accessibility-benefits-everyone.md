Increasing accessibility benefits everyone in the end. While certain features are designed for people with disabilities, many other folks also find them helpful. Accessible U notes that the [benefits of accessible design](https://accessibility.umn.edu/importance-accessibility/benefits-accessible-design) can also help:

- people developing their English language skills;

- people using older technologies to access the internet;

- people in very loud or very quiet environments where speech is difficult or impossible to understand;

- people using mobile devices: the [Pew Research Centerreported](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/) that, as of 2021, 28 percent of people aged 18-29 depend on smart phones for online access, and 15 percent of Americans rely on mobile devices as their only form of high speed Internet access.
