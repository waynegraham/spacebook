Accessibility work improves access for everyone by removing barriers, and is important for many reasons:

*   **It’s the law!** The W3C web page for [Web Accessibility Laws & Policies](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1694718798265808&usg=AOvVaw38B8wlUq_q2hIgRG--JGqK) includes relevant laws by country, including the United States [Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/united-states/%23americans-with-disabilities-act-of-1990-ada-as-amended&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1694718798266351&usg=AOvVaw2fRyntIm23FGD5YlRB4Ycn) and [Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act of 1973](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/united-states/%23section-508-of-the-us-rehabilitation-act-of-1973-as-amended&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1694718798266644&usg=AOvVaw02Cgdcm901MCDw8kBPdCwo). Read the [Payan v. LACCD explainer](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dredf.org/2021/12/16/payan-v-laccd-explainer/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1694718798266873&usg=AOvVaw1MvTHBENt87bEpKyUM54JS) for greater understanding.
*   **It minimizes risk**. It may minimize legal risk [Business Case for Digital Accessibility](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1694718798267315&usg=AOvVaw1CnTZ6P5BwPMBJ747heNgm) as well as operational risks.
*   **It benefits everyone**, while still remaining focused on users with disabilities. Learn more on the W3C web page for [User Experiences and Benefits to Organizations](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/users-orgs/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1694718798267734&usg=AOvVaw2JdxMzUeSIrdyLumRv1Yjl).
*   **It increases usage** of materials and the patron base. Learn more on the W3C web page for [User Experiences and Benefits to Organizations](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/users-orgs/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1694718798268163&usg=AOvVaw1FRH_zeInTrLLW-ECZ0d1l).
*   **It builds a healthy institutional culture** of belonging and continued improvement, and validates individual efforts allowing them to succeed by having organization commitment codified in a policy.
*   **It’s the right thing to do**; accessibility is a human-rights  cause.

Disability is more prevalent than some might think:

*   27% of adults live with some type of disability ([CDC](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/documents/disabilities_impacts_all_of_us.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1694718798269033&usg=AOvVaw0HjyfBtvdJp2TLAefsR76s), 2023), 
*   19% of undergraduate students reported having a disability in 2015/16 ([NCES](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id%3D60&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1694718798269576&usg=AOvVaw1pF8eJB5GqiXo7jnzNK9NC)), 
*   48% of students reported having or have had a diagnosed mental health condition in 2020 ([Boynton health survey](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://boynton.umn.edu/surveys&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1694718798270074&usg=AOvVaw2z_1F4PCMOOQkGtxU3Eua5)), and
*   100% of people will experience a disability at some point in their life according to [Axess Lab](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://axesslab.com/statistics-on-disabilities/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1694718798270559&usg=AOvVaw3YNknpAhntyCA5NyhvDRW0).

While accessibility is focused on people with disabilities and should remain that way, everyone will experience a disability, because disability can be:

*   **permanent**, or something that will not go away over time (such as Turner Syndrome);
*   **temporary**, such as an injury that will eventually heal;
*   **situational**, for example, when someone forgets their glasses they may experience situations when they have visual impairment.

Impairments can also be physical, cognitive, or emotional, whether: 

*   invisible, for example, hearing loss or cognitive disabilities such as dyslexia, or
*   visible, for example, using a mobility device.
