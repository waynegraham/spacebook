The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) has outlined [The Business Casefor Digital Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/),
which includes how it may:

- [drive innovation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/#drive-innovation);

- [enhance your brand](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/#enhance-your-brand);

- [increase market reach](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/#increase-market-reach);

- [minimize legal risk](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/#minimize-legal-risk).

Their case outlines how:

- Accessible content is ranked higher in search results.

- Accessible documents and transcripts can be searched by individuals and automated systems such as search engines.

- Flexible designs ensure access for individuals with diverse abilities, learning styles, and devices.

- Diversity that includes the experiences of people with disabilities creates a more vibrant, rigorous community, enriching research and scholarship.
